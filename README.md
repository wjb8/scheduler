# Interview Scheduler

The interview scheduler is a single page app (SPA) that allows a student to book and manage an interview with a mentor. When the application is loaded, a list of days of the week is displayed, along with the corresponding appointments for that day. Choosing another day will refresh the list with that day's appointments. Each day displays the number of appointment spots remaining, and will update in real time when an appointment is booked or canceled. Users can create new appointments and edit/delete existing appointments.
